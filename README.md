Hello!

Here is my code challenge submission.

You can run tests for the project by running the command `cmd+u` in Xcode or by navigating to `Rapptr_iOS_TestUITests` and clicking
the play button next to the class.

This project uses a mix of SwiftUI, UIKit as well as cocoapods(pods in GIT repo) for a image loading library.

Thanks for looking!
